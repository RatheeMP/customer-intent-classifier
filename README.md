AI prototype to classify customer messages into intents
# Customer Intent Classifier (AI Prototype)

## Problem
Customer support teams receive thousands of messages daily.
Manually identifying intent is slow and inefficient.

## Solution
This AI prototype classifies customer messages into:
- Complaint
- Question
- Feature Request
- Praise

## How it Works
- Uses a pretrained zero-shot NLP model
- No training required
- Runs in a Jupyter Notebook

## Example
Input:
"I love the new update, great work!"

Output:
Praise

## Disclaimer
This is a prototype built for rapid experimentation and hackathon demos.
